# Windows-API-Malware
this is my malware development repository. i will frequently post my projects with updates. This is for educational purposes only do not use my code for illegal purposes. 


1. the findUser program, once compiled, you need to find the pathway of the exe and paste into command line
2. then for the second argument you need to find the PID of a running process and use that then run.

 
 
This is just a POC, no real payload has been injected into the .rsrc file !!!!!
and also it hasnt been moved into a temporay buffer so it cannot be changed during runtime. 

please use carefully
